# RealmToDo

This is a small application I did for the CocoaHeads in Hamburg on how to integrate Realm in a small project.

You can follow the steps I made with the git tags:

## v1

* Empty application with a simple UITableViewController

## v2

* Add a simple list that is backed by an array

## v3

* Add an ViewController that has an UITextField to enter a new item

## v4

* Add realm instead of the static array

## v5

* Add the ability to add a strikethrough to a finished item

## v6

* Add another section for the UITableView to display finished and unfinished items
